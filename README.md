# SE-Utilities

A number of utilities and libraries for SpaceEngineers in-game scripts.
This is primarily for my own use, though anyone is free to use this (and contribute of you like)
The PID controller is a straight copy from the MDK wiki, original code by Whiplash141. I will probably write my own in the near future.

# Current Projects:
The current project is a library for working with sprites, intended to make life a lot easier when using textures that are comprised of multiple sprites.
It will also allow displaying text in SE's Fr√§ulein font, wich would allow for example to rotate said text.
Lastly, a menu infrastructure with automatisch variable subsitution a la sprintf is planned
